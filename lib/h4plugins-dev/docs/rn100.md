## **CHANGED**

  * [PangolinMQTT](https://github.com/philbowles/PangolinMQTT) upgraded to v1.0.0
  
    Reflecting its continued stability, [PangolinMQTT](https://github.com/philbowles/PangolinMQTT) has matured to version 1.0.0. There have been some changes to its API, and since [H4P_AsyncMQTT](h4mqtt.md) is a "wrapper" around PangolinMQTT, you may need / choose to re-visit your API usage. For example there are several new (and easy to use) API calls for dealing with specific data types in the payload.

    The error-handling has been improved and you may alo want to add the new `onMqttError` callback handler for more information on any connection problems.

  * SPIFFS Replaced by LittleFS (ESP8266 Targets)

    Users should notice very little change: The main change is to download the [LittleFS upload tool](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin) and add it to the IDE and use this where previously you used "ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload"

    SPIFFS remains for ESP32 Targets
